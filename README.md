# Starick

>Starick is a charity supporting women and children escaping domestic and family violence. We work predominantly in Perth's south-eastern metropolitan region. Our vision is to build futures free from violence for the women and children who use our service and for the community as a whole.

A progressive web app aiming to raise funds and awareness for Starick.

## Stack

* Typescript
* Next.JS for frontend + backend
* Mocha + Chai for testing
* TailwindCSS for styling
* ESLint + Prettier for linting

## Getting Started

First, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (either of versions 18 or 20 is fine).

Then, install the dependencies by executing the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing

```sh
npm run test
```
