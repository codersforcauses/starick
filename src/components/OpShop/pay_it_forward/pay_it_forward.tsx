      <p>
        Starick&apos;s <strong>Pay it Forward</strong> op shop gift vouchers are
        a simple way for you to help us help women and children escaping
        domestic and family violence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You simply buy a gift voucher to a set value, and we ensure it goes to
        someone in our service who needs it. Women and children escaping
        domestic and family violence often arrive at our refuges with just the
        clothes they stand up in. Through our outreach support programs, we also
        meet women out in the community who are escaping family and domestic
        violence and have very little for themselves and their children.

        toys, books, crockery and other useful household items.
