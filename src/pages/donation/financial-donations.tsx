                <p>Financial Donations</p>
                <p>Financial donations are the simplest way for you to help Starick provide the support that is essential to our clients. This is because financial donations enable us to direct money where it is most needed at any one time, by building on the core services that we are already providing with government funding.</p>
                <p>Financial abuse is part of the pattern of domestic violence. It can render women without any income in the short term and keep them in poverty for years after the relationship has ended.</p>
                <p>Many women who come into our refuges have no access to money and they often rely on us for financial support to meet their basic needs.  Meeting these basic needs is part of keeping women safe.</p>
                <p>If you would like to donate to Starick and choose how your donation is used, you can do this too. For instance, some of our donors specify that funds are to be used for a particular program or used for clothing and other supplies at the refuge.</p>

                <p>Every Dollar Counts</p>
                <p>The following information will give you a sense of just how much money we need to raise to provide services to women and children escaping domestic and family violence. Any financial donation - no matter how small - can assist us in enhancing and increasing the support we are able to provide to women and children at risk.</p>

                <p>$50 would enable us to provide emergency provisions, toiletries and groceries to one woman arriving at our refuge with nothing but the clothes she stands up in.</p>
