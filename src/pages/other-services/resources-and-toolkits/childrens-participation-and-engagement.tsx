                    Supporting empowerment and participation is critical in creating 
                    an organisation that is safe for children and young people. 
                    It is particularly important for children and young people are 
                    victim survivors of family and domestic violence as they can be at greater risk of further abuse. 
                    They may also find it more challenging to speak up and to believe
                     that adults will take them seriously.

                    Building the capacity of staff in family and domestic violence services 
                    across the state to encourage consultation with children and young people 
                    in decision making, was a core component of the Consultation with Children 
                    and Young Peopleâ€™s Engagement Project. This included professional development 
                    workshops delivered by the Youth Affairs Council of Western Australia to enhance 
                    staff understanding and knowledge of Child Safe Organisation National Child Safe Principle 2:
                    Children and young people are informed about their rights, participate in decisions 
                    affecting them and are taken seriously.

                In addition a consultation resource toolkit was developed to support services 
                ongoing engagement with children and young people. This tool kit is provided below.

                Our commitment is to support children and young people to have a voice in decisions 
                that affect them, as well as education about their right to be listened to and heard.

                We believe that including the voices of children and young people in all aspects 
                of service delivery gives them greater control over their lives, enhances their safety 
                and leads to the development of services that better reflect their interests and needs.

                This toolkit includes evidence-based and evidence informed resources and information 
                for staff to engage children and young people in planning, decision making and seeking 
                feedback into their daily practice.
